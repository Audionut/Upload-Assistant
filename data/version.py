## Notes
- UA will now try and automatically find a torrent from qBitTorrent (v5+ only) that matches any site based argument. If it finds a matching torrent, for instance from PTP, it will automatically set . In other words, you no longer need to set a site argument ( or  or --whatever (or  and/or ) as UA will now do this automatically if the path matches a torrent in client. Use the applicable config option to disable this default behavior.

- Some mkbrr updates, including support for  and rehashing for sites as needed.

Instead of relying solely on guessit to catch episode titles, UA now pulls episode title information from TMDB. There is some pre-filtering to catch placeholder title information like 'Episode 2', but you should monitor your TV uploads. Setting  with an empty space will clear the episode title.

Conversely (reminder of already existing functionality), setting met with some title  will force that episode title.
